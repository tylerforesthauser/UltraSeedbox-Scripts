If you'd like to run the latest version of FileBot (4.8.5 as of 12/2/2019) and you've purchased a license, you can install it using the instructions below:

1. `mkdir filebot-portable && cd filebot-portable`
2. `sh -xu <<< "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no5tyle/UltraSeedbox-Scripts/master/FileBot/filebot-installer.sh)"`
3. `filebot --license /path/to/FileBot_License_P1234567.psm`

Nothing more needs to be done. If you're using FileBot for your torrent client post-processing, that will now use this version of FileBot as well. Enjoy!
